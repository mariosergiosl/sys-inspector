[flake8]
# Rationale for ignored Flake8 errors in this project:
#
# E501 (Line too long): Essential to ignore due to long embedded HTML templates and C code (eBPF) strings that should not be broken.
# W503 (Line break before binary operator): Ignored to ensure compatibility with the Black formatter, which prefers line breaks before operators.
# F541 (f-string without placeholders): Ignored to allow f-strings without variables, maintaining consistency for potential future code changes.
# E402 (Module level import not at top of file): Critical to ignore as `sys.path.append('src')` is executed before importing project modules.
# E741 (Ambiguous variable name): Explicitly allowed to permit variable names like 'l' (e.g., in sys_info.py loops) which were preserved by design.
# F824: Suppressed to prevent specific plugin false positives regarding undefined or duplicate names.
