[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# C0114: Missing module docstring (we use header blocks instead)
# C0103: Variable name doesn't conform to snake_case (we adhere to BPF/C naming conventions sometimes)
# R0902: Too many instance attributes (ProcessNode needs many attributes for forensics)
# W0703: Catching too general exception (Necessary for volatile /proc scanning)
# R0402: Use 'from X import Y' (We prefer explicit imports for namespace clarity)
# W0621: Redefining name from outer scope (Common in small scripts)
# R0903: Too few public methods (We use classes as data Structs)
# W0602: Global variable not assigned (BCC requires 'global b' for callbacks)
# W0613: Unused argument (BCC callbacks have mandatory fixed signature)
# W0601: Global variable undefined (BCC pattern)
# C0301: Line too long (Embedded HTML and C inevitably generate long lines)
# C0115: Missing class docstring
# C0116: Missing function docstring
